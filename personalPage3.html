      <p>After I graduated basic training, I was offered a contract to attend the Ranger Assesment Selection Program <a href="https://www.goarmy.com/ranger/join-the-army-rangers/army-ranger-assessment.html">(RASP)</a> upon completion of Airborne School in Fort Benning, Georgia.

      capabale of if I put my mind towards something and never quit. Upon graduation, I was selected by the 3rd Ranger Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment where I served three and a half years in various Infantryman roles.<br>
