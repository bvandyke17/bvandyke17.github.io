        <h1>My Personal Life</h1>
        <p>I live in Forest Grove, Oregon with my wife and two children. No matter what is going on in life, my family always takes priority. It has been a difficult challenge finding a work-life balance between a growing family, school, and work. I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for the incredible support of my wife who is truly the only reason I am just around the corner from graduating college.
